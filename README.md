## Hydrolysis Reactor - Extract Oxygen From Water!
✔ New extractor takes water from deposits, converting some of it to oxygen <br>
✔ Excess water is usable in the life support grid like any other water <br>
✔ Additionally produces +100% oxygen and power with upgrades <br>


### Description:
New building 'Hydrolysis Reactor' takes 3 water from underground deposits and converts it to oxygen. 2 water which is not converted can be used in the life support grid like any other water. Tourists find the Hydrolysis Reactor to be an amazing feat of Martian science and engineering, making it a good stop for tours.

The reactor requires maintenance of Machine Parts x2 and a water deposit to continue working. It costs the following resources to build:  <br>
    ✔ Concrete x5 <br>
    ✔ Metals x4 <br>
    ✔ Electronics x1 <br>
    ✔ Machine Parts x2 <br>

The Hydrolysis Reactor has three upgrades available.

1) Magnetic Filtering (works exactly the same as a MOXIE) <br>
   ✔ Unlocked by researching 'Magnetic Filtering' <br>
   ✔ +50% oxygen production <br>
   ✔ Costs Polymers x5 <br>


2) Advanced Reactions <br>
   ✔ Unlocked by researching 'Nuclear Fusion' <br>
   ✔ Power Production = 2 * Oxygen Production <br>
   ✔ Costs Electronics x2 and Rare Metals x1 <br>


3) Moisture Farming <br>
   ✔ Unlocked by researching 'Moisture Farming' <br>
   ✔ +50% oxygen <br>
   ✔ Costs Polymers x5 and Metals x2 <br>

This building can be built in domes.
